    <p class="item12x2">MegaMan X was released for the Super Nintendo on December 17, 1993.  This game quite possibly has the best tutorial level in any platformer ever.  It teaches you everything you need to learn about the game and also gives you the emotional investment you need to complete the game, all in one level.</p>

    <p class="txt">If we assume the player knows nothing about the game or gaming in general it still does an amazing job teaching you everything you will need to know to beat the game.  Without wasting any time the game drops you right into the first level right from the title screen.   If you try to run left you hit a wall immediately, so you already know to advance you must run right. </p>

    <p class="txt">The player continues to run right and encounters there first enemy in the game, here the player has a few options.  The player can run away, jump, or shoot.  If we assume the player knows nothing and refuses to try anything new at first they would run all the way back to the beginning, end up hitting a wall, and then tak damage.  Now they know they have life and can make mistakes.  The player would look down at their options and start hitting the buttons on their controller showing them they can also jump and shoot.  If they player shoots and kills the enemy it's great!  If they instead jump over the game covers it.</p>

    <p class="txt">The second enemy is too tall to be jumped over so the player must shoot and defeat it, covering all bases.  Now covering the other option if the player has shot their way through both enemies, there is a hole you must jump over. Within this few couple of interactions the game teaches the most ignorant and unresponsive player its basic controls.  It is not over yet though as the game still has some more mechins it needs to teach you.  </p>

    <p class="txt">The next challenge the player must face looks easy enough, an enemy they can just run under.  If they do, the enemy will crash down, dealing damage to them.  This enemy takes both concepts of jumping and shooting and combines them together to tell the player sometime you must shoot while in the air to kill enemies and progress.  It is also a great test, a mini victory for the player, the skills they have been taught so far are reinforced in a new way.  Some of these enemies will also active early and destroy part of the stage, this quickly shows the player that some enemies may interact with the stage and create further hazards.  </p>

    <p class="txt">After going through a small platforming and enemy section the player is surprised by the first boss of the game.  A giant bee machine flies in and barrages them with bullets.  The player must keep their distance and jump over the rockets all while dealing damage back to it.  The boss is defeated easily enough, but it drops the play down into a pit with no way of jumping out. </p>

    <p class="txt">This is where MegaMan X’s design is at its peak, teaching wise.  The player has nothing to do besides jump or walk off of the bee they have just killed towards the right (because that is the way the player has already been tagh to advance too).  They will then slide onto the wall and Megaman has just enough space to slide down the wall showing the player a weird animation they have never seen before.  If they take try the two other skills they have in their reasons they will quickly learn that shooting does nothing for them but jumping might.  </p>

    <p class="txt">When they player is then taught on a complete accident that they can jump off walls.  They will then try this again to climb out and it works perfectly!   No complex tutorial or mass amount of text boxes on how to wall climb or jump, yet the player has still learned how to climb all on their own!</p>


    <p class="txt">After the player’s successful ascent they move on only to be put back in a weird situation.  As new enemy approaches something is off, the enemy isn’t flashing or taking damage even though the bullets are passing by its two long legs.  With no other options the player must shoot its big head and it will flash this time indicating damage.  This quickly teaches the player that some enemies can only be targeted at their weak point.</p>

    <p class="txt">The player is barraged by an assault of these enemies as a drop ship above them lets them loose.  The player triumphs and presses forward to fight whatever lies ahead.  Soon a huge mech drops out from the ship and it starts wrecking the player.  There is a sense of strong fear from the music combined with the aggression of this boss, the worst part is that you don’t even know if your doing damage to it as it has no health bar.
    Eventually the player is defeated and captured and the first text box appears.  The person piloting the mech taunts you, calling you nothing but a bunch of worthless scrap metal.  The game tears down all that you have done so far by being utterly destroyed by this boss you tried hard to beat.But then a sound is heard from off screen.  Some blast is charging behind you and whatever it is it sounds strong. </p>

    <p class= "txt">A beam shoots across the screen and destroys the mech's arm within one powerful shot.  A new person enters and begins charing another blast. “Can I do that?” the player thinks as the boss runs away back to his ship.</p>

    <p class="txt">Then the misteriose person speaks to you and basically says hey man, you're not as strong as me yet,  but you can be and you will be by beating the other bosses of the game.  He says he believes in you and tells you to meet him at the enemies base, with a quick “I know you can do it” Zero dashes off and the game begins.  </p>


  <h2 class="item12x">Why does any of this matter?</h2>

  <p class="item12x">This all seems fairly obvious when it's explained out like this, but it's really not. The game subtly teaches you everything you need to know about itself with no impeading text or tutorials.  Nothing is insulting the player’s intelligence or telling them what to do. This art form is lost on the modern gaming era, as games got more complex games developers needed to explain how to play them.  I believe that there is a bigger problem with the meduim as a whole, gaming compaines think people who play there games are stupid.  They lock the fun worlds they create behind ours of reading boring information and dragged out tutorials. This simply kills immersion and drags down amazing games.
<br/>
<br/>
  This is a big deal because video games are an escape from real life, they are another world where players get to experience completely unfathomable things.  A game that lets you learn its own world is incredibly satisfying and it means something to the player, this is what MegaMan X gets so right. Players are left with a sense of accomplishment and they probably don’t even know it.  The only time text is used is to set up a story that the gameplay has reinforced throughout the whole level.  You learn your weak and you’ve tasted defeat, but you also have a strong drive to beat the game and become stronger like zero.

  With my front page I tried to emulate some of the points given here, with a turned off TV, I would assume most people would try to turn it on.  Then the text pops up talking about how MegaMan X teaches you how to play its own game.  The only thing left on the screen that the user hasn't interacted with is the controller which now has a new button on. The user then clicks it to get to this page.  Nothing gets skipped because the button doesn;t show up until after the tv is turned on.
